# Changelog

## 0.1.35

- Cache bundled Pulse SVG icons with ETag, Last-Modified and immutable browser cache headers so icons are not refetched on every page navigation.
- Remove the obsolete Install BrandPulse panel now that branding is applied through the dynamic plugin CSS endpoint.
- Increase the Brand sidebar logo display area for expanded and collapsed menus.

## 0.1.34

- Load Brand logo variables through a dynamic plugin CSS endpoint registered in GLPI CSS hooks so logos are available before first page paint.
- Stop using JavaScript to set GLPI logo CSS variables, avoiding the native GLPI logo flash on page navigation.
- Reframe the Brand install panel as a cleanup note for old entity CSS snippets instead of a CSS block to paste.

## 0.1.33

- Keep generated GLPI entity CSS free of BrandPulse image endpoint URLs so native GLPI logos return cleanly when the plugin is inactive or unavailable.
- Cache imported Brand image files through their immutable `front/asset.php?file=...` URLs while keeping `field` endpoints dynamic.
- Apply Brand logo layout only while the active plugin JavaScript has marked the page as BrandPulse-branded.

## 0.1.32

- Stop applying login logos directly on GLPI `.glpi-logo` spans to avoid duplicated logo rendering on the login page.
- Avoid stacking the login background on both `body` and `.page-anonymous` in the JavaScript fallback CSS.

## 0.1.31

- Increase the generated GLPI entity CSS sidebar logo display area for expanded and collapsed menus.

## 0.1.29

- Add a recognizable BrandPulse header comment to the generated entity CSS block.
- Add a copy button for the generated Brand entity CSS.

## 0.1.28

- Add a BrandPulse installation CSS block designed to be pasted once into GLPI entity interface customization.
- Serve Brand image slots through stable `front/asset.php?field=...` endpoints so changing images does not require editing entity CSS again.
- Stop applying sidebar logos directly on GLPI `.glpi-logo` spans to avoid expanded/collapsed logo overlap and stale reduced logos after sidebar toggles.

## 0.1.27
